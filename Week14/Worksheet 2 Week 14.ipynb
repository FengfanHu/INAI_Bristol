    "# The naive Bayes classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the lecture notes that the naive Bayes classifier works as follows. We are trying to approximate an unknown function $$f:\\Omega \\rightarrow \\mathcal{O}$$\n",
    "where $\\Omega$ is our feature space and our output space $\\mathcal{O} = \\{c_1, c_2, ... c_K\\}$ is a finite set of classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The naive Bayes classifier does this by building a model that assigns the class label $\\hat{y} = c_k$ as follows:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\hat{y} = \\text{argmax}_k p(c_k)\\prod_i p(x_i| c_k)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "i.e., the $k$ that maximises this quantity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, multiplying all the $p(x_i| c_k)$ together is going to give some very small values. Therefore, we can take the log to make it easier to compute:\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{y} &= \\text{argmax}_k p(c_k)\\prod_i p(x_i| c_k)= \\text{argmax}_k log(p(c_k)\\prod_i p(x_i| c_k))\\\\\n",
    "&=\\text{argmax}_k log(p(c_k)) + \\sum_i log(p(x_i|c_k))\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",
    "If we choose that $p(x_i|c_k)$ is given by a normal distribution with mean $\\mu_k$ and variance $\\sigma_k^2$, then we obtain the following expression:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "\\hat{y} &=\\text{argmax}_k \\log(p(c_k)) + \\sum_i \\log(p(x_i|c_k))\\\\\n",
